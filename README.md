# Teatime version 2
a revamped version of my Teatime project. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/janetmndz/teatime) and an even **earlier** version [here](https://codepen.io/janmez/pen/XJgRRV)
# Notes
Teatime was one of my first projects I made when I started learning CSS3 and Javascript.

**Built using**
- Vanilla JS
- Javascript Date Object
- Sass
# What Changed & Updated
